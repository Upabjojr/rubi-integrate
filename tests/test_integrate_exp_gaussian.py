"""End-to-end integration tests via the DFS integrator (`rubi_integrate`).

Two fast tests scoped to the exponential rules exercise the complete-the-square /
ExpandToSum cycle and the Gaussian -> Erf/Erfi path.

`test_full_ruleset` (marked `slow`) loads the *entire* Rubi rule set once (~50s,
then cached) and checks a broad spread of integrals across the rule categories —
algebraic, exponential, trigonometric, logarithmic, inverse-trig, and
exponential*trig (including the Erf/Erfi and Fresnel special-function cases).

Antiderivatives that involve complex-argument erf/erfi/Fresnel functions cannot be
verified by `sympy.simplify`, so correctness is checked numerically:
d/dx(result) must equal the integrand at several sample points.
